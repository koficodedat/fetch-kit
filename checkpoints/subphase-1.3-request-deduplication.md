# Subphase 1.3: Request Deduplication Implementation

## Overview

This subphase focuses on implementing robust request deduplication to prevent redundant network calls, optimize application performance, and reduce unnecessary server load. When multiple components request the same resource simultaneously, FetchKit will intelligently deduplicate these requests to ensure only a single network call is made.

## Key Concepts

### What is Request Deduplication?

Request deduplication is a performance optimization technique that prevents multiple identical requests from being sent to the server simultaneously. When a request is in flight and another identical request is initiated, instead of sending another request, the second requester will receive the result from the first request once it completes.

### Benefits

- **Reduced Server Load**: Fewer duplicate requests to the server
- **Improved Performance**: Lower bandwidth usage and faster overall response times
- **Consistent Data**: Multiple requesters receive the exact same response
- **Reduced Race Conditions**: Eliminates potential race conditions from parallel identical requests

### Implementation Approach

FetchKit implements deduplication using a combination of:

1. **Request Key Generation**: Creating unique identifiers for requests based on URL, method, headers, and body
2. **In-flight Request Tracking**: Maintaining a registry of ongoing requests
3. **Promise Sharing**: Returning the same promise for identical requests
4. **Configurable Time Windows**: Allowing control over how long to deduplicate requests
5. **Reference Counting**: Cleaning up references when all subscribers have received their data
