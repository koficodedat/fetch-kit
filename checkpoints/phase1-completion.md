# FetchKit Phase 1 Completion Checkpoint

## Overview

This document tracks the remaining tasks for Phase 1 completion of FetchKit. Each component is broken down into subphases for granular tracking.

## Current Status

Last Updated: March 27, 2025

Subphase 1.2 (SWR Caching) has been fully implemented with all advanced features, including cache warming, multiple eviction policies (LRU, LFU, TTL, FIFO), and advanced revalidation controls (throttling, debouncing). All 327 tests are now passing.

## Components Status

### 1. Fetch Wrapper Core (Subphase 1.1)

### 2. SWR Caching (Subphase 1.2)

- [x] Complete stale-while-revalidate logic
- [x] Background revalidation mechanism
- [x] Cache invalidation strategies
- [x] Cache persistence options
- [x] Cache size limits and eviction policies
- [x] Cache warming functionality
- [x] Advanced revalidation features (throttling, debouncing)
- [x] Multiple eviction policies (LRU, LFU, TTL, FIFO)
- [x] Integration with FetchKit core

### 3. Request Deduplication (Subphase 1.3)

- [ ] Tree-shaking support
- [ ] Browser support matrix
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Release preparation

### 10. Additional Features (Subphase 1.10)

- [ ] Direct state access without subscriptions
- [ ] Optimistic updates support
- [ ] Request batching
- [ ] File operation progress tracking

- [ ] CSRF protection

## Progress Tracking

- Total Tasks: 45
- Completed: 14
- In Progress: 0
- Remaining: 31

Subphase 1.2 completion percentage: 100%

## Next Steps

1. Begin Subphase 1.3 (Request Deduplication) to further optimize network requests
2. Continue with Subphase 1.5 (Subscription System) which builds on the completed caching system
3. Update documentation for the newly implemented caching features
4. Run benchmarks to measure performance improvements from caching

## Notes

- Update this document as tasks are completed
- Mark tasks with [x] when done
- Add implementation notes under each completed task
